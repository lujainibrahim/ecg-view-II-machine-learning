# Explainable Prediction of Acute Myocardial Infarction using Machine Learning and Shapley Values

This repository is the official implementation of [Explainable Prediction of Acute Myocardial Infarction using Machine Learning and Shapley Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2030.12345). 


## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ðŸ“‹Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

> ðŸ“‹Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

> ðŸ“‹Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:
With age and sex: 
- [CNN](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ECG-ViEW II
- [RNN](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ECG-ViEW II
- [XGBoost](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ECG-ViEW II

Witout age and sex: 
- [CNN](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ECG-ViEW II
- [RNN](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ECG-ViEW II
- [XGBoost](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ECG-ViEW II

The ECG-ViEW II data was processed with robust scaling and SMOTE. Follow this [data processing notebook]() to obtain the processed data from the original csv files.
