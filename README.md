# Explainable Prediction of Acute Myocardial Infarction using Machine Learning and Shapley Values

This repository is the official implementation of [Explainable Prediction of Acute Myocardial Infarction using Machine Learning and Shapley Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2030.12345). 


## Requirements

* To install Python 3, follow these [instructions](https://realpython.com/installing-python/). 
* To install Pip, follow these [instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
* To install Jupyter Lab/Notebook, follow these [instructions](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html). To run Jupyter Lab/Notebook, follow these [instructions](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html). 

* To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* To obtain the ECG ViEW II dataset, please use this [form](http://ecgview.org/ECG_ViEW.asp). After recieving the unprocessed files, follow the [data processing](https://github.com/lujainibrahim/ecg-view-machine-learning#data-processing) steps below. 


## Data Processing

To process the ECG-ViEW II dataset as it is done in the paper (with robust scaling and SMOTE), run this [notebook]().

This notebook will produce two csv files, test.csv and train.csv, that you can then train/evaluate models with. If you would like to use the train and test files we used to obtain/reproduce our results, those can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-WcMjYm-jhuvE1vDpW76HkYW-xrOuPQ6?usp=sharing).

## Training

* To train the CNN model in the paper, run this [notebook]().
* To train the RNN model in the paper, run this [notebook]().
* To train the XGBoost model in the paper, run this [notebook]().

These notebooks will train the model and save it in a file that can be imported for evaluation later (described in the next section). 

## Evaluation

* To evaluate the CNN on the processed ECG-ViEW II data, run this [notebook]().
* To evaluate the RNN on the processed ECG-ViEW II data, run this [notebook]().
* To evaluate the XGBoost on the processed ECG-ViEW II data, run this [notebook]().

To reproduce the results in the paper, use the [pretrained models](https://github.com/lujainibrahim/ecg-view-machine-learning#pre-trained-models) and this [data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-WcMjYm-jhuvE1vDpW76HkYW-xrOuPQ6?usp=sharing).
